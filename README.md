# Script-Writing-Templates-and-Functions
My own scripts templates (for example, I will commit to always use a "StopWatch" in all my scripts to write how much it took to execute) ... also will include progress bars, samples to define and populate PowerShell objects, etc...
## Template-* files
### Template-Comments-*
Includes common structure with comments, variables part, functions part, ...
### Template-Sam-*
Create a Template-Sam-* which is a template I'll use all the time for example to include script execution time, logging file definition with date and time stamp, variable declaration part, functions part, etc...
## Function-*
Simple or more complex functions that I find useful and that can pick when I need these (for example, logging functions, there are 2 I like for now : a simple one, and a more complex one from Sam Boutros, a great powershell developper)
## How-To-*
Simple scripts with a lot of comments, intended to help you understanding some concepts of PowerShell that are useful in a day-to-day life of a PowerShell scripter.
Example, the first one created on this site is a "How-To-User-ProgressBar.ps1" super-commented script to drill down the required steps to create a PowerShell progress bar...
