PREREQUISITES :

1- the account with which you launch the below export script MUST be a member of a role group
that has the "Mailbox Import Export"  rights. On PCO, that role group is "Mailbox Exports"
NOTE: If such a Role Group does NOT exist, see Sam's blog post on the LINK section below...

2- The UNC path where you export the PST must start with double slashes, and it seems that it works
only when you export on Exchange servers (Exchange Trusted Subsystem account seems to be needed as local admin
of the machine where you export the PST)


.EXAMPLE

[PS] C:\Users\super-ssc-sm\Documents>.\Export-RestoreFolderToPST.ps1

Will export the folder that you hard coded on the variable $FolderToRestore
from the mailbox that is specified in the variable $MailboxToExport
and it will put it on the UNC path specified in the variable $UNCFilePathToExportThePST
