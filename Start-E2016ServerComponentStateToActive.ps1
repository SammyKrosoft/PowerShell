.SYNOPSIS
Bring Exchange components to active state.
.DESCRIPTION
Bring Exchange components to active state.
.PARAMETER HybridServer
Indicates to check 2 additional Server Components that are important for
Office 365 synchronization between the On-premises environment and the
Exchange Online environment : "ForwardSyncDaemon" and "ProvisioningRps".
.PARAMETER CheckOnly
Indicated the script to only check which Components are inactive before
attempting anything.
.EXAMPLE
.\Start-E2016ServerComponentStateToActive.ps1 -HybridServer -CheckOnly
Will check all Server Components, including ForwardSyncDaemon and ProvisioningRps
components, but won't attempt to start these.
.EXAMPLE
.\Start-E2016ServerComponentStateToActive.ps1
Will check all Server Components, excluding the ForwardSyncDaemon and ProvisioningRps,
and attempt to start these.
The script will tell you if the operation was successful or not.
.EXAMPLE
.\Start-E2016ServerComponentStateToActive.ps1 -HybridServer
Will check and try to start all Server Components, including ForwardSyncDaemon and ProvisioningRps
.EXAMPLE
.\Start-E2016ServerComponentStateToActive.ps1 -CheckOnly
Will check all Server Components, excluding ForwardSyncDaemon and ProvisioningRps
components, but won't attept to start these.

    .SYNOPSIS
    This small function will just check if you have Exchange tools installed or available on the
    current PowerShell session.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The presence of Exchange tools are checked by trying to execute "Get-ExBanner", one of the basic Exchange
    cmdlets that runs when the Exchange Management Shell is called.

    Just use Test-ExchTools in your script to make the script exit if not launched from an Exchange
    tools PowerShell session...

    .EXAMPLE
    Test-ExchTools
    => will exit the script/program si Exchange tools are not installed
    #>
    Try
    {
        Get-command Get-MAilbox -ErrorAction Stop
